## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photos/okubo01.jpg">

I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow 
at [Harvard University, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences](https://eps.harvard.edu){:target="_blank"}.

## Research Interest

My research interests include earthquake source mechanisms, energy budget of earthquakes and ground motion caused by dynamic earthquake ruptures.
Seismological observations bring a lot of information on the earthquake source and the structure of the Earth by comparing them to theoretical models, derived from solid mechanics. However, sometimes there are still discrepancies between the observations and theoretical models (e.g. high-frequency radiation in near-field), implying additional factors which conflict with the assumptions made in the models. My goal is to identify and quantify the factors using the state-of-the-art techniques (e.g. continuous observation of seismic wave velocity structure, physics-based dynamic earthquake rupture modeling), which enable us to better understand the source mechanisms, the overall energy budget and the consequent ground motion.

_Key words: Ambient seismic noise monitoring, dynamic earthquake rupture modelling, off-fault damage, earthquake source mechanics, combined Finite-Discrete Element Method (FDEM)_
