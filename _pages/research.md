## [Earthquake Damage Patterns Resolve Complex Rupture Processes](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018GL078842){:target="_blank"}

First published: 12 September 2018

We modeled dynamic earthquake ruptures on the Papatea – Jordan - Kekerengu fault system associated with the 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaikōura earthquake for two hypothetical rupture scenarios with spontaneous activation of coseismic off-fault damage. This work demonstrates that comparison of damage pattern inferred from observations to the models helps identify the earthquake rupture path.
