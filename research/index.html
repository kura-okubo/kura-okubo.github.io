    Laboratory Experiments
      
     Verifying and Expanding Theoretical Predictions through Large-Scale Laboratory Friction Experiments.
     By controlling source conditions and minimizing uncertainties in both source characteristics and wave propagation paths, we seek to validate theoretical hypotheses regarding earthquake rupture processes. Furthermore, we update the source mechanisms inferred from these laboratory experiments, which will contribute as analogs for natural earthquakes.

    Dynamic Rupture Modeling
    Spatiotemporally High-Resolution Fault Rupture Dynamics: Essential for Understanding Earthquakes.
    
    Modeling dynamic earthquake ruptures with co-seismic off-fault damage, by incorporating small-scale source heterogeneities, using the combined finite-discrete element method (FDEM) implemented in the Hybrid Optimization Software Suite (HOSSedu). We investigate their effects on rupture dynamics, seismic radiation, and the overall energy budget.

    Ambient Noise in Observational Seismology
    Monitoring Fault Over Decades to Address the Earthquake Generation Mechanisms in Real Time Scale.
    
  
  The decadal, terabyte-scale seismic dataset enables the investigation of fault state evolution. We conducted ambient seismic noise cross-correlation using 20 years of data from Parkfield, operated by the 
  High-Resolution Seismic Network (HRSN) and archived at the 
  Northern California Earthquake Data Center. Using in-house Julia-based software, SeisIO.jl (currently maintained as SeisBase.jl), and a comprehensive software package SeisMonitoring.jl, we were able to handle this large dataset.
